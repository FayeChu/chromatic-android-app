### App Name
Chromatic (The app-release.apk can be found inside the chromatic-android-app/Chromatic/app/)

### Project Description
Chromatic is a camera application allowing designers, artists, photographers, and any other uses with a desire to seek colors found naturally and around the world to simply extract the inspiration in their photos and lay them out as palettes and mood boards. It can be used to create customized color palettes and mood boards, and its main purpose is to check if different color fit each other or they can form specific coloring scheme by placing them together. Chromatic allows users to take or import photos to create palette anytime, anywhere. In preview, palette scheme will be given automatically and then users can manually capture colors in the picture, set relevant information, and save it for further use. For the mood board, the app enables users to select palettes created before, interact with them via actions of draging, rotating, zooming, moving, adding text, concatenating, etc. and save created mood board with specified information. Beside these two main functionalities, users can explore/review the palettes and mood boards they created before in the gallery.
